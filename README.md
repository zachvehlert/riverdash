# River Dash

This is the repo for my river level dashboard app. The site is live at riverdash.info

## Usage

To add a river, select the add new river button. Select a state and search for a gauge you want to track. You can change the display name, measurment unit, and update the minimum and maximum runnable flows.

## Color Codes

### River Level
Red - Above or below runnable flows<br />
Green - Within Runnable flows<br />
Blue - No runnable flows defined<br />

### Trend Data
Light Blue -  Rising<br />
Grey - Flat (also says flat)<br />
Orange - Falling<br />
